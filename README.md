## About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a shell simulator for an infection scenario. The simulation starts with one infected person and one doctor while everyone else is normal. Whenever the infected person touches another person, they get infected, and so on. The doctor can cure people so that they don't get infected.

## Usage
```
$ make

$ ./infectsim
```
